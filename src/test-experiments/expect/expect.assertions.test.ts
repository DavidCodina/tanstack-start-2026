// After the test has passed or failed verify that a certain number of assertions was
// called during a test. A useful case would be to check if an asynchronous code was called.
// For example, if we have a function that asynchronously calls two matchers, we can assert
// that they were actually called.
//
// In the following example we are testing doAsync(). However, by expecting two assertions to have
// been called we are implicitly testing that doAsync() has executed its callbacks and that there
// is a truthy arguments passed to each callack. This is kind of like an alternative to spying
// on the callbacks.
