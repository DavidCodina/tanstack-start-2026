      // With Resend, you have to use specific email adddresses that resend provides
      // for testing purposes. If you have a Pro account ($20/month), you can use your
      // own domain email. Actually, it seems you can have one free domain per account.
      //
      // For now, I've hardcoded the `to` address to go to delivered@resend.dev.
      // Obviously, this means the end user won't receieve the email at their true email for now.
      // Instead, go to resend.com/emails -> Sending to view the email.
      //
      // When clicking on the "Verify Email" link from within Resend's preview dashboard, it won't work.
      // You actually need to right-click, and open link in a new tab.
      //
      // In a real email (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.) the link will be fully clickable — it's a standard
      // <Link> (anchor tag) in the HTML, so email clients render it normally. The reason it's not directly
      // clickable in Resend's preview dashboard is that Resend's preview runs in their cloud environment,
      // and localhost URLs are unreachable from there.
      //
      // In development, that will take you to: http://localhost:3000/ by default. However, I've changed the logic
      // in in sendVerificationEmail() such that it now redirects to /login?verified=true.
      // At that point the user's emailVerified will change to true in the database.
      // This is all demonstrated in the Brett Westwood tutorial at 40:20: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qJ4-H00e0g
