//
// The problem here is that we've coupled the connection with the theme.
// When we connect, we want to be able to pass the theme to the toast that
// indicates that the user is connected. However, now if the theme changes,
// it will cause the connection to disconnect and reconnect.
//
//   Solution 1: We can remove theme from the dependency array, but then we get this warning:
//   ⚠️ React Hook React.useEffect has a missing dependency: 'theme'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.
//   Then we would hack it with something like: eslint-disable-line.
//
//   Solution 2: Use const themeRef = React.useRef(theme) to bypass the usEffect dependency array.
//
//   Solution 3: Implement the new useEffectEvent() hook.
//
// With all of that said, there was a time when useEffect's linting simply didn't complain
// when you omitted dependencies. Admittedly, this would cause a stale closure, but as long as
// you knew what you were doing, it wasn't a big deal.
//
// So.. Why Not Just Relax the Linting? React's philosophy is: "Make the right thing easy, and the wrong thing hard".
// If they relaxed linting, they'd be telling developers: "Sure, go ahead and read stale values! Good luck debugging that later!"
// In other words, if the linting was relaxed, omitting theme from the deps in this case would be a perfectly fine solution.
// However, it's also probable that some developer would come along later and implement a useEffect somewhere else and
// create a bug by forgetting to add something crucial to the deps.
//
// The "Expert vs. Footgun" Problem: React is making a framework-level decision: "Do we optimize for experts who know what
// they're doing, or prevent footguns for the majority?" React's stance is essentially:"We can't distinguish between
// 'developer who knows what they're doing' and 'developer who will create a bug'. So we make the safe path the default."
